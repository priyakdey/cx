# cx

**cx** is a small collection of explicit, dependency free **data structures for C**.

The goal of this project is to provide **simple, well-defined stb-style single
header file libraries**.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a learning and educational project, but the APIs are designed to be
> **real world usable**. Saying that, this is probably something not to be used
> in any production application.
